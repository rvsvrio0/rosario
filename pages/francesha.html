        <p>I cannot even begin to describe the totality of the movie, as although, movies(as i believe) are not a form of art that need to be described so as to process them.
        what i can begin to emphasize is the feeling it transmitted, i was really dazzled with the characters and the complexity and banality that communed within them</p>
        <img src="../movie-images/francesha (5).png" alt="Frances Ha" class="francesha5" />
        <p>The absence of colors was a really nice experience, it emphasized the characters emotions and expressions, i conclude. 
        The shadow-contrast darkness of the eyes actually brought out their brightness and deepness.
        </p>
        <p>Frances is very much not understood, the snowlines of her persona is trapped in the fast moving emotions, racing lights, running moments of the world. She always tried to express the most out of the situations she encounters, and is always the last one to leave them. </p>
        <img src="../movie-images/francesha (6).png" alt="Frances Ha" class="francesha6" />
        <p>(*moments too*)</p>
        <p> Love was so very important for her. 
        And her love—be it romantic or not—was totally and completely for her best friend Sophie. And although Sophie did truly <i>see</i> Frances, she was moving in the river of the world, while Frances hovered on a lagoon. 
        Change made the biggest contrast to help me see Frances's character. She is always too nice, too apologetic, very sincere, which is way she was completely helpless when <i><b>herself with different hair</b></i> was going away, and then further... further. She couldn't <i>really</i> tell her anything, but feel impotent and fragile.</p>
        <p>Because not precisely  possessively, or sexually, the love she wanted was Sophie, ultimately, when that love she was sure of was put into a situation that made it fragile, doubtful, is that she was left in an empty field and her mind was tired.</p>

    <p class="videodescription"><i>(right after she received the news that her best friend quit her job and was moving to Japan through another person)</i></p>
        <P>When leaving this movie i will not try and label their relationship, i will not say Frances was a lesbian in love with her straight friend, and that Sophie was platonically in love with Frances.

        Because we don't stop and categorize emotion-full moments, because life is so ephemeral that sometimes, (even though i am in favor of rationality and deep thought) the seeing and empathizing, feeling, and crying for no reason, or smiling with no rational motive; is enough. </P>
